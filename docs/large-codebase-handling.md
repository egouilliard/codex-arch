# Large Codebase Handling

This document outlines the strategies implemented in Codex-Arch for handling large codebases efficiently.

## Challenges

Large codebases present several challenges:
- Memory constraints during analysis
- Performance bottlenecks in graph operations
- Query response times
- Visualization complexity

## Implementation Strategies

### 1. Hierarchical Analysis

Codex-Arch implements a hierarchical approach to codebase analysis:
- Initial pass at directory level to establish structure
- Progressive analysis of specific directories as needed
- On-demand loading of detailed entity information

### 2. Graph Partitioning

For very large codebases, the knowledge graph is partitioned:
- Each module or major component forms a subgraph
- Cross-partition relationships are maintained as references
- Queries can span multiple partitions when needed

### 3. Lazy Loading

The system implements lazy loading patterns:
- Entity details are loaded only when accessed
- Relationship traversal is performed incrementally
- Results are streamed rather than loaded all at once

### 4. Caching Strategies

Multiple caching layers improve performance:
- In-memory cache for frequent queries
- Persistent cache for parsed file information
- Incremental updates to avoid full reanalysis

### 5. Incremental Updates

When changes occur in the codebase:
- Only affected files are reanalyzed
- Entity and relationship changes are tracked
- Graph is updated incrementally

### 6. Query Optimization

For large graphs:
- Queries use index-based lookups where possible
- Search algorithms are optimized for large graphs
- Results can be limited and paginated

### 7. Visualization Techniques

When visualizing large codebases:
- Multiple levels of detail are provided
- Focus+context techniques show relevant portions
- Progressive loading of visualization components

## Configuration Options

The following options can be configured for large codebase handling:

- `maxEntitiesPerFile`: Limits entities extracted per file
- `maxDepth`: Controls relationship traversal depth
- `chunkSize`: Size of chunks for incremental processing
- `cacheStrategy`: Memory vs. disk caching preferences
- `parallelProcessing`: Number of parallel processing threads

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance with large codebases:
- Use SSD storage for Neo4j database
- Allocate sufficient memory to Neo4j
- Consider distributed processing for very large projects
- Use targeted queries rather than full-graph retrieval

## Benchmarks

Codex-Arch has been tested with:
- Codebases up to 1M+ lines of code
- Projects with 10,000+ files
- Complex dependency relationships (100,000+ edges)

Performance scales approximately linearly with codebase size when using the recommended configuration options.
